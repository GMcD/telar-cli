# Telar CLI - Setup Telar Social on OpenFaaS (Free Tire)

## Step 1 (Let's start)

### 1. Enter your valid Github username

Register you Github account on OpenFaaS [from here](https://github.com/openfaas/community-cluster#apply-for-access).
> OpenFaaS introduces an automated build and management system for your Serverless functions with native integrations into your source-control management system whether that is GitHub or GitLab. With OpenFaaS functions are managed through typing `git push` which reduces the tooling and learning curve required to operate functions for your team. As soon as OpenFaaS receives a push event from `git` it will run through a build-workflow which clones your repo, builds a Docker image, pushes it to a registry and then deploys your functions to your cluster.

We use Github to manage Telar Social source code and get advantage of automates CI/CD triggered by `git push`.


### 2. Enter the project directory path

Telar CLI will clone all Telar Social source code inside this directory.
